# 7 Days to Die Alpha 20 Mods

## Info (07-13-2022)
This mod does quite a few different things with only XML, I do plan on making it better by making a .DLL mod along with it. This mod makes the game easier by making things easier to obtain early on, I did this as I work with other adults and we don't normally get a large amount of time to grind the game like necessary in order to get far in game, so things like killing zombies and gaining XP and getting skill points are much easier, alot of other little quality of life changes as well. If you like it or hate it or want a change please let me know. This [discord](https://discord.gg/fUcCmAJsBZ) I made particularly for users of the mod, I can be found there if you need me, Enjoy!!   

___IMPORTANT: Mods for 7 Days to Die will never come in .exe form, Do not trust random applications.___ 

## Installation Instructions

+ To install the mod, click the green <img src="https://i.imgur.com/UggsYwz.png" alt="drawing" width="50" height="20"/> button top right, then click   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PM4liVg.png" alt="drawing" width="150" height="20"/> , open the file you downloaded with an extraction tool such as [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/fileadmin/winrar-versions/winrar/th/winrar-x64-602.exe) or [7 Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z2106-x64.exe). 
  + The folder you extracted should be called `7DTD-Mods-A20-main`, now open that folder, there should be a folder inside named `RobbieWs Vanilla Mods`. 
  + Now move that folder to your `Mods` folder in your 7 Days to Die directory, if you do not have one, make one.        
+ Your directory should now look like this:
```c
steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\RobbieWs Vanilla Mods

    <h3>How to Edit</h3>
  </summary>
  
Okay if you would like to edit the mod, you will need some experience with XML. I have alot of comments in it though so hopefully that helps.   
+ Navigate to the mod folder, open the Config folder, now edit the XML files to your liking.   
+ If you want to know how to edit a SPECIFIC thing about the mod, let me know and I'll leave how in the next update.   
+ Example Pt 1: How to edit how many skill points you gain per level. Open the Progression.xml file.   
+ Example P2 2: On line 52 there should be the following code;     
```xml
<set xpath="//level/@skill_points_per_level">5</set>
```   
+ Example Pt 3: Edit the number 5 to whatever you would like it to be, this will change the amount of skill points gained per level.   
+ Bonus Info: `<!--- --->` is a comment and is not read by the game, furthermore if you are using Visual Studio Code you can do `<!--- #region --->` then adding your code and then doing `<!--- #endregion --->` below and it will be collapsable in the editor.
