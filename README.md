    <h3>Information</h3>
  </summary>

*(Disclaimer: Some GIFs/Images may take a bit to load)*   

This mod does quite a few different things with only XML, this mod makes the game easier by making things easier to obtain early on, I did this as I work with other adults and we don't normally get a large amount of time after work to grind the game like necessary in order to get far in game.    

So things like killing zombies and gaining XP and getting skill points are much easier, alot of other little quality of life changes as well. If you like it or hate it or want a change please let me know.      

This [discord](https://discord.gg/fUcCmAJsBZ) I made particularly for users of the mod, I can be found there if you need me, Enjoy!!    

    

___IMPORTANT: Mods for 7 Days to Die will never come in .exe form, Do not trust random applications.___

    <h3>How to Edit</h3>
  </summary>
  
Okay if you would like to edit the mod, you will need some experience with XML. I have alot of comments in it though so hopefully that helps.   
+ Navigate to the mod folder, open the Config folder, now edit the XML files to your liking.   
+ If you want to know how to edit a SPECIFIC thing about the mod, let me know and I'll leave how in the next update.   
+ Example Pt 1: How to edit how many skill points you gain per level. Open the Progression.xml file.   
+ Example Pt 2: On line 52 there should be the following code;     
```xml
<set xpath="//level/@skill_points_per_level">5</set>
```   
+ Example Pt 3: Edit the number 5 to whatever you would like it to be, this will change the amount of skill points gained per level.   
  
  
+ Bonus Info: `<!--- --->` is a comment and is not read by the game, furthermore if you are using Visual Studio Code you can do `<!--- #region --->` then adding your code and then doing `<!--- #endregion --->` below and it will be collapsable in the editor.
